## ToDo List

The goal of this project is to create a ToDo list using ReactJS and the Material UI component library.

The following criteria must be met:

- Should be a single page application
- A user should be able to add and remove items from the to-do list.
- A user should also be able to track a 'completion' status for each item
- When adding a new to-do item, a dialog should be presented to the user, with a text field that allows for the user to input the text that should be displayed for that to-do item.
- A user should be able to edit existing to-do items. You may choose and implement whatever method you consider to be most appropriate for accomplishing this.

Additional features that were added:

- Items may be reordered by dragging and dropping
- Items may be deleted from the list
- The user may add a note for each to-do item
- Each to-do item can be expanded to display the note
